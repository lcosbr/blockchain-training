# Blockchain Wallet Training App

This app has been created on the Angular and Block Chain Concepts training, which was provided by RÃ´mulo Zoch. 

I've improved the visual and all the pages available on this application. Also corrected the search balance bug, who was occuring on the first version. 

List of all technologies used: Angular CLI 7, NPM, GIT(GitHub), VSCode IDE, Bootstrap, NGX-Bootstrap, Datatables and Father Google :)
